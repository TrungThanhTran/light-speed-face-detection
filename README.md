# a super light speed face detection
Yunet is one of the fastest (maybe lightest) face detection in the world with only 75M params but achieve pretty well performance. There are some thing we can improve on top of it and this repo is to do so.

This repo strongly based on [Yunet training repo](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection.train).
